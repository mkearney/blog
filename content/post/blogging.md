<!--more-->

So I decided to start a blog. I always need excuses to write, and it
seems like blogging offers some instant gratification---maybe not
enough to compete with Twitter but it's at least a faster turn around
than academic outlets. I'm also hoping it can help me to improve some
of my writing habits, generally. I currently have a bad habit of
incessantly typing, deleting, retyping, etc. every sentence over and
over. I'd consider the process worth it if I were an especially
creative or imaginative writer. But I'm not. When I do the
type-delete-retype song and dance, I'm almost always just trying to
make the sentence more efficient or flow better. Goals which are, of
course, invariably easier when I wait a day or two before
editing. Ideally, blogging with some consistency would help me learn
how to write first (emphasis on volume) and edit later (emphasis on
quality). We'll see how it goes. Right now, typing two paragraphs is a
bit exhausting. If my posts get longer after a few months of blogging,
I'll consider it a success.

Aside from writing goals, my decision to blog is also inspired by
seeing people who have (a) been blogging long enough to amass an
impressively large archive of neat posts and (b) made the rotation for
[R-bloggers](https://www.R-bloggers.com) broadcasts. I need to look
into the latter---it's possible that could happen sooner rather
than later---but the former I'll file under *long-term* goals.
