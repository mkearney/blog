I started using R about two years ago. I didn't hear about it until
about 3 or 4 years ago, when it earned the occasional reference in an
advanced stats class. Even in those classes, R was never required or,
at least explicitly, encouraged. The only real exposure I had was when
the "equivalent R code" was attached to a homework assignment that
otherwise assumed we were using Mplus or SAS. The R code was provided
in case any of us happened to be R users. As far as I could tell, none
of us [non quant-psych students] were. The teaching assistants, on the
other hand, gravitated toward it. Most of the stats classes I took
were offered by the quantitative psychology program. The TAs for the
classes were actually taking a lot of the same stats classes that I
was taking, so I'd sit next a quant psych grad student in one class,
and they'd be my TA in the next one.
